## Interest of Content

Good - the information appears to be written by the authors, and the actual content covered is interesting, although the information is a little sparse.

## Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation

Acceptable - each separate article is readable in its own unique way. Marked up for Hashim's picture.

## Quality of Written Presentation

Good - the actual text isn't *bad*, and I like the use of lists and images to make your points.

## Validity of HTML

Weak - the index page is an MD file, rather than HTML, so it doesn't work unless renamed. Hashim and Josh's pages do not appear to have any CSS in them at all, and Josh's still contains git merge conflict markers. The other three are better, but aren't consistent with each other at all and in some cases still have issues, mainly with responsiveness and text size.

## Evidence of Collaboration

Weak - no two pages have consistent styling, except the two with no styling. Much of the work seems to have been done by one member, and that on the last day. Actually, hang on, the guy who did most of the commits made one *during the practical* that specifically broke the index page. What's going on in this group? Marked up from Unacceptable out of pity.
